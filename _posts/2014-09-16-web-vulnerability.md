#### Two Main Approaches to Testing Software Application

In __white-box__ testing, the source code of application is analyzed in an
attempt to track down defective or vulnerable lines of code. This operation is
often integrated into the development process by creating add-on tools for
common deveploment environments.

In __black-blox__ testing, the source code is not examined directly. Instead,
special input test cases are generated and sent to the application. Then, the
results returned by the application are analyzed for unexpected behavior that
indicate errors or vulnerabilities.
